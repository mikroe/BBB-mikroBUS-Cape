BeagleBone-mikroBUS-Cape
=================

BeagleBone Cape to support up to 4 mikroBUS boards.

All files that are needed. The .dts and the .dtbo files are located in the tar, this is to make sure you allways have a clean copy. This cape uses device tree overlays. 

NOTE: At this point in time these examples are only fully functional on Angstr√∂m, Debian support is partial.
